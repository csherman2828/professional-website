      content="I am Christopher Sherman, and this is my webpage. I am currently
        seeking a software development or engineering internship to gain industry
        experience. I am a fourth year Computer Science student
        at Illinois Institute of Technology, on
        track to graduate in Winter 2021 with my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science.
        Additionally, I am a Teaching Assistant for CS, part of IIT's NASA Robotic
        Mining Competition Team, and a member of the Alpha Epsilon Chapter of Phi
        Kappa Sigma at IIT. Find out more about me on this site!">
